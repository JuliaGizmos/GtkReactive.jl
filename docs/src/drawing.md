# A simple drawing program

Aside from widgets, GtkReactive also adds canvas interactions,
specifically handling of mouse clicks and scroll events. We can
explore some of these tools by building a simple program for drawing
lines.

Let's begin by creating a window with a canvas in it:

```julia
using Gtk.ShortNames, GtkReactive, Graphics, Colors

win = Window("Drawing")
c = canvas(UserUnit)       # create a canvas with user-specified coordinates
push!(win, c)
```

A few concepts from Cairo are important here:

- all drawing occurs on a `canvas` object, which corresponds to a region of a window
- Cairo canvases can use two different coordinate systems: screen
  pixels, often called [`DeviceUnit`](@ref), and a user-specified
  custom coordinate system, called [`UserUnit`](@ref).

Here we specified [`UserUnit`](@ref) units for our drawing and
mouse-position units; we chose these to be (0,0) for the top left
and (1,1) for the bottom right. With this choice, if a user resizes
the window by dragging its border, our lines will stay in the same
relative position.

We're going to set this up so that a new line is started when the user
clicks with the left mouse button; when the user releases the mouse
button, the line is finished and added to a list of previously-drawn
lines. Consequently, we need a place to store user data. We'll use
Signals, so that our Canvas will be notified when there is new
material to draw:

```julia
const lines = Signal([])   # the list of lines that we'll draw
const newline = Signal([]) # the in-progress line (will be added to list above)
```

Now, let's make our application respond to mouse-clicks. An important
detail about a `GtkReactive.Canvas` object is that it contains a
[`MouseHandler`](@ref), accessible with `c.mouse`; this object
contains `Reactive.Signal` objects for mouse button press/release
events, mouse movements, and scrolling:

```julia
const drawing = Signal(false)  # this will become true if we're actively dragging

# c.mouse.buttonpress is a `Reactive.Signal` that updates whenever the
# user clicks the mouse inside the canvas. The value of this signal is
# a MouseButton which contains position and other information.

# We're going to define a callback function that runs whenever the
# button is clicked. If we just wanted to print the value of the
# returned button object, we could just say
#     map(println, c.mouse.buttonpress)
# However, here our function is longer than `println`, so
# we're going to use Julia's do-block syntax to define the function:
sigstart = map(c.mouse.buttonpress) do btn
    # This is the beginning of the function body, operating on the argument `btn`
    if btn.button == 1 && btn.modifiers == 0 # is it the left button, and no shift/ctrl/alt keys pressed?
        push!(drawing, true)   # activate dragging
        push!(newline, [btn.position])  # initialize the line with the current position
    end
end
```

`sigstart` is also a signal; we won't do anything with it, but we
assigned it to a variable to prevent it from being
garbage-collected. (We could use `GtkReactive.gc_preserve(win,
sigstart)` if we wanted to keep it alive for at least as long as `win`
is active.)

Once the user clicks the button, `drawing` holds value `true`; from
that point forward, any movement of the mouse extends the line by an
additional vertex:

```julia
const dummybutton = MouseButton{UserUnit}()
# See the Reactive.jl documentation for `filterwhen`
sigextend = map(filterwhen(drawing, dummybutton, c.mouse.motion)) do btn
    # while dragging, extend `newline` with the most recent point
    push!(newline, push!(value(newline), btn.position))
end
```

Notice that we made this conditional on `drawing` by using
`filterwhen`; `dummybutton` is just a default value of the same type
as `c.mouse.motion` to provide for `filterwhen`.

Finally, when the user releases the mouse button, we stop drawing, store
`newline` in `lines`, and prepare for the next line by starting with
an empty `newline`:

```julia
sigend = map(c.mouse.buttonrelease) do btn
    if btn.button == 1
        push!(drawing, false)  # deactivate dragging
        # append our new line to the overall list
        push!(lines, push!(value(lines), value(newline)))
        # For the next click, make sure `newline` starts out empty
        push!(newline, [])
    end
end
```

At this point, you could already verify that these interactions work
by monitoring `lines` from the command line by clicking, dragging, and
releasing.

However, it's much more fun to see it in action. Let's set up a
[`draw`](http://juliagraphics.github.io/Gtk.jl/latest/manual/canvas.html)
method for the canvas, which will be called (1) whenever the window
resizes (this is arranged by Gtk.jl), or (2) whenever `lines` or
`newline` update (because we supply them as arguments to the `draw`
function):

```julia
function drawline(ctx, l, color)
    isempty(l) && return
    p = first(l)
    move_to(ctx, p.x, p.y)
    set_source(ctx, color)
    for i = 2:length(l)
        p = l[i]
        line_to(ctx, p.x, p.y)
    end
    stroke(ctx)
end

# Because `draw` isn't a one-line function, we again use do-block syntax:
redraw = draw(c, lines, newline) do cnvs, lns, newl  # the function body takes 3 arguments
    fill!(cnvs, colorant"white")   # set the background to white
    set_coordinates(cnvs, BoundingBox(0, 1, 0, 1))  # set coordinates to 0..1 along each axis
    ctx = getgc(cnvs)   # gets the "graphics context" object (see Cairo/Gtk)
    for l in lns
        drawline(ctx, l, colorant"blue")  # draw old lines in blue
    end
    drawline(ctx, newl, colorant"red")    # draw new line in red
end
```

A lot of these commands come from Cairo.jl and/or Graphics.jl.

Our application is done! (But don't forget to `showall(win)`.) Here's a
picture of me in the middle of a very fancy drawing:

You can play with the completed application in the `examples/` folder.
